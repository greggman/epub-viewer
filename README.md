# ePub-Viewer

[https://greggman.github.io/ePub-viewer](https://greggman.github.io/epub-viewer).

Why? 

1. Because I don't trust native apps.

   Native apps can hack your machine, install rootkits, etc.
   The browser is *generally* far more secure

2. Because most other online epub-viewers track you one way or another.

## Notes

There really isn't much to this. It's all just a tiny wrapper on [epub.js](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js).
